Configuration
-------------

Download Soxy and extract the `soxy` file to your machine.

Copy the provided `config.sample` file to `~/.soxy/config` and edit it for your configuration:

    REMOTE_USER='YOUR_USERNAME'
    REMOTE_HOST='TARGET_HOSTNAME'
    REMOTE_PORT='22'

    LOCAL_PORT='1080'

    AUTO_RECONNECT=false

Make the `soxy` file executable by running:

    chmod +x /path/to/soxy


Installation
------------

Add a bash alias by adding the following to `~/.bash_aliases`:

    alias soxy='/path/to/soxy'

If you haven't already, you will also need to generate an RSA key pair with the
following command:

    ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "<your_hostname>"

Now copy your public key to the remote host with the following command:

    ssh-copy-id user@example.com

You can now start the SOCKS proxy connection with the following command:

    soxy start


Client Setup
------------

### Ubuntu

Navigate to [Gear Icon] -> System Settings -> Network. Select _Network proxy_ from
the left hand menu.  Under the _Method_ drop-down box, select `Manual`.  For
_Socks Host_ enter `localhost`, and enter the port you used (default is `1080`).


### Firefox

From the Firefox menu navigate to Preferences -> Advanced -> Network (tab) then
under the _Connection_ heading click on the _Settings_ button. In the menu that pops
up select _Manual proxy configuration_. Now set the _SOCKS Host_ to `localhost`
and the corresponding _Port_ to the port you specified (default is `1080`).

Additionally, enable DNS request proxying by checking "Remote DNS"


### Chrome

You can use this Plugin:
[Proxy SwitchyOmega](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/proxy-switchyomega/padekgcemlokbadohgkifijomclgjgif)

It's also possible to define black/white lists based on URL patterns and
control exactly which route should be used (multiple proxies possible + direct).


Run on Start Up (Ubuntu)
------------------------
You can configure Soxy to start at boot by adding it to Startup Applications in
Ubuntu.  Navigate to [Gear Icon] -> Startup Applications and click the Add
button.  For name enter "Soxy", then for Command put `/your/path/to/soxy start`
and hit the Add button.

Now, whenever you first log into your system, Soxy will automatically start a
SOCKS connection for you.


Periodically Check Connection and Automatically Re-connect
-----------------------------------------------------------
User cron jobs can be defined with `crontab -e` on most linux distributions. A
possible setup could look like this:

    ## run every 10 minutes
    */10 * * * * /path/to/soxy status

If you want the script to attempt a re-connect as soon as the connection drops,
you can set `AUTO_RECONNECT=true` in your `~/.soxy/config`.


Usage
-----
**Start the SOCKS connection**

    soxy start

**Stop the SOCKS connection**

    soxy stop

**Restart the SOCKS connection (stops then starts)**

    soxy restart

**Get the status of the SOCKS connection**

    soxy status
